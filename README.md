# Single-cell Stereo-seq analysis script of Arabidopsis leaves



* *r21.PCA-sample-and-DEGs.R*: R script for performing the PCA analysis on every two cell types, and the marker of each cell type was identified. It generates the following figs: 2C and 2E.
* *r22.PCA-3D-plot.R*: R script for drawing the 3D scatter plot for each two samples. It generates figs. 2E, and S2E-I.
* *r31.Basic_ploting.R*:  R script for drawing a gene violin map according to cell type, and performing enrichment analysis on genes to produce enrichment results. It generates the enrichment results of Figs: 3A, 3B, 3E, S3A, S3D, 4C, 4F, 5B and 5F.
* *r32.Epidermal-subcluster.R*: R script for epidermal cell subpopulation analysis. It generates the following figs: 3C and 3D.
* *r33.Mesophyll-subcluster.R*: R script for Mesophyll cell subpopulation analysis. It generates the following figs: S3B and S3C.
